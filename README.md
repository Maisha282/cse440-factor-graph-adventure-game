# cse440-factor-graph-adventure-game
An interactive adventure quest game that uses factor graphs for probabilistic decision-making in a dynamic narrative. Player choices influence story outcomes through adaptive, branching paths.

# Overview

This game models player decisions and story events as a factor graph, allowing the narrative to evolve dynamically based on probabilistic updates after each choice.

# Features

1. Interactive, choice-driven storytelling

2. Factor graph-based decision modeling

3. Multiple possible endings

4. Command-line interface for gameplay


# Installation & Running

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cse440-factor-graph-adventure-game.git

cd cse440-factor-graph-adventure-game

pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py

# How It Works

1. Player choices update the factor graph probabilities.

2. The story progresses dynamically based on these updates.

3. Different choices lead to varied endings.


# Future Work

1. GUI integration

2. More complex story graphs

3. Learning player behavior for adaptive storytelling
